            <p>SME owners and employees, unable to align their thinking, fight a losing battle in many ways. Inability to move in sync results in workplace frustration. Processes hit speed bumps or stall at vital times. Much of the problem relates to disorganization at the top of the hierarchy. Sometimes, it's moving from crisis to crisis instead of a natural project sequence. Inevitably, optimization and effectiveness suffer, resulting in employee churn that can cripple profitability and deflate ROI substantially.

            <h4>"It's a crucial opening gambit that's mutually beneficial to see if we're a good fit. Generally, after a session like this, the client knows if our input will work for them or not. We aim to instill a system, where previously disarray - even chaos - reigned. Our approach is logical, technology-centric, and transitions the team to a systematic approach. It connects essential considerations directly to ROI. It works especially well when we see that the company is outgrowing business processes, and all that's needed is broadening one's vision."</h4>
